# Aquastat 0.0.1

This package was created for the MSiA Analytics Value Chain course. 

Functions from this package can be used on FAO's AQUASTAT dataset.

From FAO: 

FAO's three main goals are:
1. The eradication of hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition
2. The elimination of poverty and the driving forward of economic and social progress for all
3. The sustainable management and utilization of natural resources, including land, water, air, climate and genetic resources for the benefit of present and future generations. 

To support these goals, Article 1 of its constitution requires FAO to "collect, analyse, interpret and disseminate information related to nutrition, food and agriculture". Thus AQUASTAT started, with the aim to contribute to FAO's goals through the collection, analysis and dissemination of information related to water resources, water uses and agricultural water management, with an emphasis on countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean.

FAO offers data, metadata, reports, country profiles, river basin profiles, regional analyses, maps, tables, spatial data, guidelines, and other tools on:
* Water resources: internal, transboundary, total
* Water uses: by sector, by source, wastewater
* Irrigation: location, area, typology, technology, crops
* Dams: location, height, capacity, surface area
* Water-related institutions, policies and legistation
